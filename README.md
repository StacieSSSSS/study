Self-Evaluation: Year-End Review

Manage Risk

Since joining the offshore CNY rates trading team, I have proactively taken ownership of risk management within my responsibilities. Through daily tasks such as assisting with client trade unwinds, internal booking, and supporting pricing processes for NDIRS and CNH cross-currency swaps, I have developed a solid foundation in identifying and managing risk exposures across our books.

I consistently adhere to daily P&L sign-offs and contribute to end-of-day risk checks, ensuring accurate trade capture and reconciliation. While shadowing senior traders, I have also developed a keen awareness of intraday risk movements and the impact of liquidity shifts on pricing, particularly during key macro events like CPI releases and central bank meetings.

I contributed to internal risk culture by researching and documenting the dynamics behind NDD (non-deliverable deposit) spreads and their implications for funding risk and liquidity mismatches. These insights helped improve pricing assumptions in the internal pricer.

Moreover, I maintained thorough records of client inquiries and trade flows, which contributed to better forecasting of client behavior and improved pre-trade risk discussions. My attention to operational and market risk factors also ensured no limit breaches or trade capture issues during my tenure thus far.

Drive Operational Excellence

Over the past few months, I have actively contributed to improving process efficiency and data integrity across the desk. I worked on validating and reviewing pricing curves used by our internal pricer, helping to identify mismatches in curve construction logic that previously caused misalignments in pricing outputs. This directly enhanced the accuracy of front-office tools and pricing consistency for client RFQs.

I also supported our team’s workflow by simplifying and structuring our internal inquiry logs, helping streamline the tracking of client interest and improving the team’s internal communication. These efforts contributed to more efficient idea generation, faster response times to client requests, and greater operational clarity.

My research into offshore RMB liquidity trends—particularly around quarter-ends and regulatory windows—was incorporated into internal commentary, which has been used by traders in decision-making and by sales in client discussions. This has strengthened our operational responsiveness to macro liquidity shifts and improved internal forecasting efforts.

Drive Growth

Despite being new to the team, I have contributed meaningfully to both client-focused initiatives and internal research that supports revenue generation and responsible growth. I developed a CPI forecast model leveraging both onshore and offshore indicators, which helped inform macro views for RMB rates and supported trade ideas for both NDIRS and CCS.

By studying client behavior and tracking inquiry patterns, I provided inputs into pricing strategies that aligned with client expectations, especially during volatile periods. My involvement in developing and testing pricing methodologies for complex product structures has allowed our desk to price faster and more competitively.

I also played a key role in supporting cross-border client trade flows by assisting with internal hedging strategies and understanding the impact of basis and funding on CNH CCS pricing. These experiences enhanced my understanding of the “whole bank” offering and helped align desk strategy with broader client franchise objectives.

Great Place to Work

I actively seek opportunities to collaborate with colleagues across trading, sales, and support teams to enhance communication and team performance. As a new joiner, I have made it a priority to ask questions, share knowledge from my research, and contribute to a positive learning culture. I have also received informal recognition for my willingness to take on ad-hoc tasks and support the desk’s daily needs with a high degree of reliability.

Through my participation in team knowledge-sharing sessions and willingness to engage with senior colleagues, I aim to contribute to a supportive and high-performing environment. I consistently uphold the firm’s values around transparency, respect, and accountability.
